            <p><strong><span class="style43">Q. Can you tell me how much it will cost to overhaul my transmission?</span></strong><br />
            </p>
            <p><span class="FAQAnswer"><strong>A.)</strong> When it comes to pricing a transmission repair or rebuild, there are several factors that need to be investigated to determine the specific cause of your transmission problem. We offer to all our customers our free External Transmission Diagnostic Service, which will help to identify what type of problem may exist, and what would be the best and most cost effective solution for the repair of your automatic or standard transmission problem. This External Transmission Diagnostic Service includes checking the transmission fluid level and condition.<br />
              <br />
            We will road test your vehicle for any drivability issues, and we will check your electronically controlled transmission for any diagnostic trouble codes that may be in your vehicle's computer memory, if your vehicle has this capability. Many transmissions can be fixed without a rebuild or overhaul. To better understand your transmission’s problems and to provide you with a comprehensive and accurate estimate, we invite you to bring in your car for a free diagnosis. Remember, the most expensive repair is the one you didn’t need.</span></p>
            <p><br />
              <strong><span class="style43">Q.) What does this mean to me?</span></strong><br />
              <span class="FAQAnswer"><br />
            <strong>A.)</strong> We are dedicated to improving our customer’s auto repair experience. Through these memberships and affiliations, we are able to offer our employees up-to-date training and utilize the knowledge, experience and education of thousands of technicians world-wide.</span></p>
            <p><br />
              <strong><span class="style43" style="line-height:21px">Q.) In addition to a specific problem with my car, I was told I needed several other services and repairs by another shop/dealership. Since the estimate was quite high, how do I know if I really need everything they said?</span></strong><br />
              <br />
              <span class="FAQAnswer"><strong>A.) </strong>We are happy to give you an unbiased second opinion for free. We can double check any recommended maintenance services based on your vehicle’s mileage. We provide you with our own comprehensive estimate based on our trained technician’s completed inspection of your vehicle. Our estimate is designed to help you make the right repair choices. Each recommended repair or service is prioritized; we will always tell you what is necessary to fix your initial problem and/or prevent any major safety issues. Realizing that most people don’t live on an unlimited budget, we’ll also let you know the services or repairs you can safely postpone. We will never pressure you into making an on-the-spot decision. Feel free to ask many questions and to compare our estimate against the one you have.</span></p>
            <p><br />
              <strong><span class="style43">Q.) Why do I need to service my automatic transmission?</span></strong><br />
              <br />
              <span class="FAQAnswer"><strong>A.)</strong> The automatic transmission in your car is essentially a gigantic hydraulic pump. It uses transmission fluid to transfer engine torque to the drive wheels through a &quot;torque converter&quot; to a series of valves and pumps to control fluid flow and pressure. As with the other fluid systems on your car, much is expected of this fluid and it deteriorates rapidly with heat, contaminants, and oxidation--it will tend to thicken over time and not flow as needed and reduce the efficiency of this unit, as well as shorten its useful life. Transmission failure is very costly and routine maintenance is the best way to prevent that from happening. Most manufacturers recommend servicing the transmission fluid every 30,000 miles.</span></p>
            <p><br />
              <span class="style43"><strong>Q.) What's the difference between a transmission service and a flush?</strong></span><br />
              <strong><br />
              <span class="FAQAnswer">A.)</span></strong><span class="FAQAnswer"> A transmission service consists of: A test drive and evaluation of the transmission’s performance by a trained technician Removal of the transmission pan Replacing the fluid and installing a new filter Making any necessary adjustments The transmission flush is performed by attaching a machine to the transmission which re-circulates and cleans the fluid. The flush does not typically include a filter change. At our shop, we only service transmissions because we feel it is a better way to maintain and prolong the life of your transmission.</span></p>
            <p><br />
              <strong><span class="style43">Q.) Why does my check engine light come on?</span></strong><br />
              <br />
              <span class="FAQAnswer"><strong>A.)</strong> There are literally thousands of reasons why your check engine light could come on. It could be as simple as a loose gas cap or a dirty air filter. However, the check engine light can prevent you from passing your state inspection and greatly affects your gas mileage.</span></p>
            <p><br />
              <span class="style43"><strong>Q.) What are my maintenance schedules?</strong></span><br />
              <br />
              <span class="FAQAnswer"><strong>A.) </strong>Through online subscriptions, our shop has access to the most current manufacturers’ recommended maintenance schedules for all makes and models of cars, both foreign and domestic. We are able to perform the factory recommended services based on your car’s mileage. We keep your car’s service and repair records in our computer system and can send you reminders about upcoming recommended services.</span></p>
            <p><br />
              <span class="style43"><strong>Q.) What is a timing belt?</strong></span><br />
              <span class="FAQAnswer"><br />
              <strong>A.) </strong>Most vehicles today are using timing belts, which is a flat rubber belt with teeth. It synchronizes valve and piston movement inside your engine. They are lighter, quieter, more efficient and more economical than the timing chains that were more common on older vehicles. Like any other part on your engine the timing belt eventually wears out. Vehicle manufactures usually recommend timing belt replacement every 60,000-90,000 miles. It is very important to replace the belt before it breaks as it may cause major engine damage. A broken belt can result in an open valve being struck by a moving piston. This can damage valves, pistons, cylinder heads, and cylinder walls. In addition to the inconvenience and the cost of a tow you may need a new engine.</span></p>
            <p><br />
              <span class="style43"><strong>Q.) Why do I need to flush my coolant system?</strong></span><br />
              <span class="FAQAnswer"><br />
              <strong>A.)</strong> Over time coolant is depleted of buffering ingredients and becomes extremely corrosive, literally eating holes in cooling system components. By-products of corrosion, as well as rust and scale, clog the passageways that conduct the water through the radiator and choke off the flow. This may result in an overheated engine that may be damaged beyond repair. The entire cooling system is first cleaned and then all debris and worn out coolant is completely flushed from the system. Then, fresh new premium coolant is added. Conditioners are also included to prevent rust and corrosion and cooling system sealer is also included to prevent leaks. Manufacturers recommend flushing the system every 30,000 miles for most vehicles or if the coolant is contaminated, is acidic, or its freeze point protection is not adequate.</span><span class="style6"><span class="style10"><span class="style41"><br />
